This is a intuitive [Game Maker Studio: 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) extension which enables fast Socket.IO communication for the client!

You don't need any objects which initializes the extension or anything else. Just call `sio_connect()` or `sio_connect_by_url(url:string)` in order to connect to the server, that's all! :)
